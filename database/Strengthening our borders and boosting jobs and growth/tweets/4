Alas, could not post the cartoon but it was by Pope and showed Peter Dutton hosing the older lady who was supporting the refugee rather than the burning refugee.  Peter Dutton unbelievably blames those who help and support asylum seekers for their self harm.  He then went on to lecture these people telling them they must stop supporting them.  Dear Peter, it is you who must stop this ridiculous game your government is playing just to get votes.

Hi Peter Dutton, I just read your claims that people have used social media to encourage asylum seekers to self harm so they can be taken seriously. given the lack of evidence for this claim, I thought I'd try a little experiment. I encourage you to self harm so you can be taken seriously. Please report back on how it goes.

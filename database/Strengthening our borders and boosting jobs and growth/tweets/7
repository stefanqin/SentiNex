The thing I can't get over is the sheer cruelty you perpetuate, Peter Dutton. If a woman is raped and becomes pregnant in one of YOUR detention centres and wants an abortion, there should be swift action to get her one. Putting her through additional mental anguish is cruel and unusual punishment, and you should know this automatically as any sort of decent human being. This sort of thing enrages me. Pick up your game and fix it so that people in detention at the very least are not in physical and mental danger.

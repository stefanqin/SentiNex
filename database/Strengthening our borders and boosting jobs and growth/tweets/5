Your attitude is unChristian and unAustralian. We used to be a country that was about helping other people, now we're about persecuting the innocent, to the point where they are driven to horribly painful suicide. I fail to see how we can maintain our rage against ISIS and the Taliban for their persecution of women, when we are just as willing to punish their victims. And there's no point attacking Labor on this issue - they support your racism wholeheartedly. The Greens are the only party with a humane refugee policy, and from what I've seen on social media, their support is increasing rapidly.

Ok, excellent now let's take a break. A moritorium on immigration until we absorb those that we have. We have, per capita, done more than our share. Now it is time to look after our own internal issues. Then when we have stabilised perhaps we can once again be of help to others.

Not only should the number of asylum seeker categories and boat arrivals, be slashed, but skilled immigration numbers - plus family reunions.  The pressure on services and infrastructure means massive costs, debt and austerity.  The growth mantra should end, and we need to make the transition to a stable population size, and a sustainable economy. 

When Dutton says, " 57,400 for family Â­migration" does he mean family reunion for asylum seekers?

I hope NOT.
